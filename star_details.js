What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A0, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B."

If Betelgeuse were at the center of our Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars."

It is the brightest star in the constellation and the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, with a visual magnitude of 0.13. Rigel is a multiple star system, with the primary star being a massive supergiant over 100,000 times as luminous as the Sun."
